# Aceso: Achieving Efficient Fault Tolerance in Memory-Disaggregated Key-Value Stores

This is the implementation repository of our *SOSP'24* paper: **Aceso: Achieving Efficient Fault Tolerance in Memory-Disaggregated Key-Value Stores**.

This artifact provides the source code of **Aceso** and scripts to reproduce the experiment results.

The current repository has been relocated to the [dmemsys](https://github.com/dmemsys/Aceso) hub.
